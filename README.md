Portfolio Pages using Bootstrap to style

The idea here is to style a portfolio page using bootstrap so the layout is the same as "Basic-Portfolio" but is responsive. 

I used the link to bootstrap to allow for styling, and then over-wrote some styling using my own, in a separate CSS file (in the assets/style folder).
