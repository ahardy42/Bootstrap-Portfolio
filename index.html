                <p>My name is Andy Hardy. I currently live in Frisco Colorado
                    with my wife, Katie. We moved here from the Boston
                    area in 2014, leaving our old jobs, and lack of snow, happily behind us. Above all, I like to spend
                    time
                    outside. I ski in the winter, I bike and run in the summer, and almost always I am thinking about
                    when I am
                    going to do one of those activities next. This is what brought me to Colorado!</p>
                <p>For the last 15 years I have been a chemist in some
                    capacity. I left a job at a major pharmaceutical company
                    when
                    I left Boston, and immediately starting selling ski boots. After the first season I painted lift
                    towers for
                    a
                    summer, but didn't really dig the stresses of seasonal work, so I found a job formulating adhesives
                    in
                    Breckenridge. I really enjoy learning new things, and this new job satisfied that requirement for a
                    few
                    years.
                    Though I have a good job, I am curious about possibilities for more flexibility, yet a stable
                    income. This
                    brings me to coding.</p>
                <p>I have gotten my feet wet with a few online classes. I took
                    a React.js class last summer, built a spotify
                    playlist generator, and I enjoyed it. What brings me to the boot camp is a desire to get deeper into
                    full
                    stack
                    development, and to understand what is required in a devlopment job. I think I made the right
                    choice!</p>
